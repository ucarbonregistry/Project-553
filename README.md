# Project-553
Wind bundle project in Maharashtra by Sispara

The project activity involves installation of 35.5 MW capacity wind power generation project out of
which 12 MW is developed and operated by “M/s Sispara Renewable Power Private Limited” 6
MW capacity wind power generation project by “M/s Kalsubai Power Private Limited”, 10 MW by
“M/s Nilgiri Power Private Limited” and 7.5 MW capacity wind power generation project by “M/s
NSL Wind Power Company (Sayamalai) Pvt. Ltd” hereinafter called as project proponent or PP,
engaged in the capacity of an Independent Power Producer (IPP) focusing on developing green
power projects in India. The project activity is defined as the installation and operation of total 22
Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) having individual capacity of 1.5 MW for 17 WTGs and 2.0 MW
for 5 WTGs; having different mechanism such as Regen & INOX. Thus, the total aggregated
installed capacity is 35.5 MW, is operational in the Satara and Sangli district of Maharashtra State,
India

The project activity harnesses kinetic energy of wind (renewable source) to generate electricity. It is
capable to generate around 62,196 MWh of annualized average green electricity, which is estimated
based on an operational utilization factor of 20% with efficient utilization of the available wind
energy through adoption of an efficient and modern technology. The power generated by this
project activity has been supplied to Maharashtra state electricity grid, which is a part of Indian
Grid system. Thus, the project activity contributes to emission reductions which would have
otherwise caused due to the consumption of grid electricity which is predominantly fossil fuel
based. Also, the project activity helps reducing the demand-supply gap in the state and also helps in
contributing to the sustainable development attributes in the project region.

PRIOR HISTORY

The first WTG under the project was commissioned on 31st March 2015 and the project is under
continuous operation since then. The entire project was fully commissioned as on 31st October2015.

The project was mainly invested based on carbon revenue; hence the project was initially registered
under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as sub projects, titled “Wind Power Project by M/s
Sispara Renewable Power Private Limited in Maharashtra, India”, “Wind Power Project by M/s
Kalsubai Power Private Limited in Maharashtra, India”, “Wind Power Project by M/s Nilgiri Power
Private Limited in Maharashtra, India”, “Wind Power Project by M/s NSL Wind Power Company
(Sayamalai) Pvt. Ltd. in Maharashtra, India”. 

Also was registered under VCS mechanism (VCS ID 1660) to secure position under voluntary platform. The crediting period of the project
under VCS was started on 13th February 2015 and ends on 12th February 2025. The project has already claimed carbon credits under VCS for the period “13th February 2015 and ends on 12th February 2025”. Thereafter, the project was considered under VCS mechanism till 12th February 2025. However, the project has not been further under VCS beyond 12th February 2025.

In continuation with the same, the UCR project has been considered crediting of GHG emission
reductions from 13th February 2025. Hence, the first monitoring period considered under UCR is
from 13th February 2025, thus there is no concern of double accounting of emission reductions.
